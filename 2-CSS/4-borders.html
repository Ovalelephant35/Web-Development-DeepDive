        <h1>Now Darksied website will have CSS styling</h1>
        <p id="p1" class ="odd">In the desolate realm of Apokolips, a looming terror reigns supreme – Darkseid, an embodiment of malevolence and unrelenting darkness.
            Shrouded in an aura of maleficence, he stands as an unyielding figure of horror, his very presence casting a chilling shadow upon the hearts of those unfortunate enough to cross his path.
            With eyes like smoldering pits of cosmic fire, Darkseid's gaze pierces through the soul, siphoning hope and replacing it with a sense of impending doom.</p>
        
    
        <p id="p2">The airitself seems to thicken in his presence, as if the universe recoils from his nefarious aura. His cold, rumbling voice reverberates like a haunting melody, 
            spreading fear like a contagion to all who hear it. In the haunting glow of Apokolips' blood-red sky, Darkseid's imposing figure emerges – a towering titan, his dark armor
            forged from the very essence of suffering. With each step, the ground trembles, mirroring the quaking hearts of those who dare to defy him.</p>
       
        
        <p id="p3">Darkseid's insidious influence extends beyond his physical form, delving into the realm of psychological torment. His mastery over the Omega Effect, a power that can 
            erase beings from existence, leaves victims consumed by a paralyzing dread, knowing that their very existence could be snuffed out by his malevolent will. Even the strongest of heroes are not immune to the tendrils of fear that Darkseid's dark
            charisma and dominion over fear can wrap around them.In the darkest corners of the cosmos, tales of Darkseid's cruelty and insatiable hunger for power echo like haunting whispers. He is not merely a villain; he is a cosmic horror, a force that defies understanding and leaves a trail of broken worlds and shattered spirits in his wake. His quest for the Anti-Life Equation, a cosmic formula that grants him control over all sentient life, paints a grim tableau of a universe plunged into eternal despair. Darkseid stands as a testament to the boundless depths of darkness that can fester within the heart of a being, and his legacy is one of unending terror and chilling malevolence.</p>
