            <p>In the ominous realm of Apokolips, the malevolent presence of Darkseid looms like an unrelenting nightmare. His towering obsidian form, encased in intimidating armor, radiates an aura of pure dread that freezes even the bravest of hearts.

                As you approach the throne room of Darkseid, the air grows thick with an oppressive darkness, suffocating and consuming every glimmer of hope. The walls seem to whisper of the countless souls that have fallen under his dominion, their anguish echoing through the cold stone.</p>
